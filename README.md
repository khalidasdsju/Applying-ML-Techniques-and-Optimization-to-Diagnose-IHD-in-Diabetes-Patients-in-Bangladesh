Applying Machine Learning Techniques and  Optimization to Diagnose Ischemic Heart Disease  (IHD) in Diabetes Patients in Bangladesh:  Investigations from a Cross-Sectional Study in 2024 


Abstract  


Background: Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a predominant cause of morbidity and mortality, 
especially among diabetic individuals in Bangladesh. Early detection of ischemic heart disease is 
essential for appropriate intervention and improved patient outcomes. Machine learning (ML) 
methodologies have demonstrated potential in improving diagnostic precision for ischemic heart 
disease (IHD). This project is to utilize machine learning methodologies and optimization 
techniques to enhance the identification of ischemic heart disease in diabetic patients in 
Bangladesh. The main goal of this research is to examine the efficacy of machine learning 
techniques, encompassing algorithm optimization and ensemble learning, for identifying ischemic 
heart disease in diabetic patients via a cross-sectional study done in 2024.  


Methods: A dataset comprising clinical, demographic, and laboratory data from diabetic patients 
was analyzed utilizing fourteen distinct machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression (LR), 
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine 
(SVM), Ridge Classifier (RC), Random Forest (RF), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis 
(QDA), AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting (GB), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Extra 
Trees Classifier (ETC), Classifier Chain (CC), and Decision Forest (DF). Five-fold cross
validation was utilized for hyperparameter adjustment to enhance the model's predictive 
accuracy. The effectiveness of various models was evaluated based on accuracy and precision, 
with a specific focus on assessing their generalization abilities using accuracy analysis for each 
fold.  




Results: The evaluation metrics indicate that Gradient Boosting is the most effective model, with 
an accuracy of 0.910 and a ROC AUC of 0.9694. It consistently outperforms other models in these 
areas, indicating that it is the most reliable model for classification tasks where predicted accuracy 
and class distinction are critical. However, in terms of log loss, Random Forest demonstrates higher 
performance with a lower value of 0.2493, signifying its enhanced reliability in probabilistic 
predictions. Nevertheless, Gradient Boosting's exceptional performance in accuracy and ROC 
AUC makes it the preferable choice for most applications. 
Conclusions: The study highlights the potential of Machine Learning Techniques and 
Optimization, with Gradient Boosting being the most effective model for overall classification 
performance. Random Forest is a viable alternative for reducing log loss. Soft Voting Ensemble, 
while successful, falls short of the top models. The study also suggests that integrating 
GridSearchCV, five-fold cross-validation, and soft voting ensemble classifiers can help in early 
diagnosis and treatment planning for diabetes patients with ischemic heart disease.
